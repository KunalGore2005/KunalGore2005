## About Me

I am a Computer Science undergraduate specializing in AI & ML.  
My primary focus is on building a strong foundation in data structures, algorithms, and core machine learning concepts, along with applying them through academic and personal projects.

I prefer understanding *why* things work rather than blindly using tools or frameworks.
